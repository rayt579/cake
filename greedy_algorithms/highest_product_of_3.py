'''
Given a list of integers, find the highest product you can get
from n = three of the integers.

BONUS:
1) What if we wanted the highest product of 4 items?
2) What if we wanted the highest product of k items?
3) If our highest product is really big, it could overflow. â†´ How should we protect against this?
