Write a function to tell us if a full deck of cards shuffled_deck
is a single riffle of two other halves half1 and half2

Definition of the Riffle Algorithm
------------------------------------
1) cut the deck into halves half1 and half2
2) take a random number of cards from top of half1 (can be 0) and throw them into the shuffled_deck
3) take a random number of cards from top of half2 (can be 0) and throw them into the shuffled_deck
4) repeat steps 2 and 3 until both halfs are empty

Takeaways:
    1) Work with the interviewer to break down the problem to digestable chunks. You need to understand the problem.
        - Problems can be reduced to fundamental data structures! This is just an array problem.
    2) Avoid using list slicing when necessary because you incur space costs. Keep track of pointers instead.

Bonus:
    1) This assumes shuffled_deck contains all 52 cards. What if we can't trust this (e.g. some cards are being secretly removed by the shuffle)?
    2) This assumes each number in shuffled_deck is unique. How can we adapt this to rifling lists of random integers with potential repeats?
    3) Our solution returns True if you just cut the deckâ€”take one half and put it on top of the other. While that technically meets the definition of a riffle, what if you wanted to ensure that some mixing of the two halves occurred?
